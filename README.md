# do you wanna build a snowman

this program plays "snowman", a more-politically-correct version of that one game that has some really unfortunate lynchy vibes

To play, type in your word with all letters you want the computer to guess replaced with `_`.

Example:

```
Type your word: 
_________


7696 words are under consideration...
('z', 56), ('e', 5694)
I think e is the best letter.
Type your word: 
_______e_


906 words are under consideration...
('x', 9), ('s', 614)
I think s is the best letter.
Type your word: 
______se_


47 words are under consideration...
('j', 0), ('d', 40)
I think d is the best letter.
Type your word: 
______sed


36 words are under consideration...
('j', 0), ('i', 25)
I think i is the best letter.
Type your word: 
___i_ised


I think your word might be one of ["mobilised", "optimised", "maximised"]
('c', 0), ('o', 2)
I think o is the best letter.
Type your word: 
o__i_ised


Your word is optimised!
